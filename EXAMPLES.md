# Sequential Thinking MCP Server Test

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Sequential Thinking
```json
{
  "tool": "sequential_thinking",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Let me break down this complex math problem step by step. First, I need to identify what we're solving for.",
    "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
    "thoughtNumber": 1,
    "totalThoughts": 3
  }
}
```

### Scenario 2: Revision of Previous Thought
```json
{
  "tool": "sequential_thinking", 
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Actually, I realize my previous approach was flawed. Let me reconsider the problem from a different angle.",
    "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
    "thoughtNumber": 3,
    "totalThoughts": 4,
    "isRevision": true,
    "revisesThought": 2
  }
}
```

### Scenario 3: Branching Reasoning
```json
{
  "tool": "sequential_thinking",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "This opens up two possible approaches. Let me explore the algorithmic solution first.",
    "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
    "thoughtNumber": 4,
    "totalThoughts": 6,
    "branchFromThought": 2,
    "branchId": "algorithmic"
  }
}
```

### Scenario 4: Getting Summary
```json
{
  "tool": "get_thinking_summary",
  "arguments": {}
}
```

### Scenario 5: Reset State
```json
{
  "tool": "reset_thinking",
  "arguments": {}
}
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Build the server: `npm run build`
2. Run the server: `npm run dev`
3. Configure in Claude Desktop or VS Code MCP settings
4. Use the tools to engage in structured thinking processes

## Expected Outputs

The server provides formatted responses showing:
- Current thought number and progress
- Revision and branching indicators  
- Completion status
- Rich formatting for readability
