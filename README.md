# Visum Thinker MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides structured sequential thinking capabilities for problem-solving and analysis. This server enables AI assistants to break down complex problems into manageable steps, revise thoughts, and explore alternative reasoning paths.

## Features

- **Step-by-step reasoning**: Break down complex problems into sequential thoughts
- **Dynamic revision**: Revise and refine thoughts as understanding deepens  
- **Branching logic**: Branch into alternative reasoning paths
- **Adaptive planning**: Adjust the total number of thoughts dynamically
- **State management**: Maintain thinking context across multiple tool calls
- **Progress tracking**: Monitor completion status and thought progression
- **PDF Analysis**: Load and analyze PDF documents for problem-solving context
- **Content Search**: Find relevant sections in PDFs based on queries and search terms
- **Persistent Storage**: Auto-save state to disk, survive server restarts
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Export/import thinking sessions between servers
- **ðŸš— Visum Integration**: Complete PTV Visum COM API integration for transportation planning
  - **Smart Path Learning**: Automatically discovers and remembers custom Visum installation paths
  - **Zero Configuration**: Once set up, works seamlessly across server restarts
  - **Demo Mode**: Full functionality testing without requiring Visum installation
  - **Transportation Analysis**: Load models, run calculations, analyze networks and matrices

- **`export_visum_results`**: Export analysis results to various formats

**Key Features:**
- **ðŸ§  Smart Path Learning**: Automatically remembers custom Visum installation paths
- **ðŸ”„ Zero Setup**: Works seamlessly after initial path discovery
- **ðŸŽ¯ Demo Mode**: Full testing capability without Visum installation
- **ðŸ“Š Complete Analysis**: All major transportation planning workflows supported

See [VISUM-PATH-LEARNING.md](./VISUM-PATH-LEARNING.md) for detailed information about the intelligent path learning system.

## ðŸ¤– GitHub Copilot Integration

The Sequential Thinking MCP Server includes comprehensive GitHub Copilot integration for enhanced AI-assisted development:

### ðŸš€ Quick Start with Copilot
1. **Server Status**: Ensure MCP server is running (`npm run dev`)
2. **Open Copilot Chat**: `Ctrl+Shift+I` in VS Code
3. **Test Integration**: Ask `@copilot List available MCP tools`
4. **Start Solving**: `@copilot Use sequential thinking to solve [your problem]`

### ðŸŽ¯ Copilot Capabilities
- **ðŸ§  Sequential Thinking**: AI-guided step-by-step problem solving
- **ðŸ“„ PDF Analysis**: Intelligent document processing and analysis  
- **ðŸš— Transportation Planning**: Expert Visum integration and workflow automation
- **ðŸ”§ Smart Configuration**: Automatic Visum path learning and persistence
- **ðŸ’¡ Context-Aware Suggestions**: Code completion with domain knowledge

### ðŸ’¬ Example Copilot Interactions
```
@copilot Can you use sequential thinking to analyze this transportation network problem?

@copilot Check if Visum is available and help me load a network model

@copilot Use the PDF analysis tools to extract data from this traffic report

@copilot Create a complete workflow for transportation demand analysis
```

See [COPILOT-INTEGRATION.md](./COPILOT-INTEGRATION.md) for comprehensive setup and usage guide.

```

### Scripts

- `npm run build`: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run dev`: Build and run the server
- `npm test`: Run tests (placeholder)

### Debugging

The server logs to stderr for compatibility with STDIO transport. Use VS Code's debugging features or add console.error statements for debugging.

## Architecture

The server maintains a global thinking state that tracks:
- All thoughts in the current session
- Current progress and estimated completion
- Revision and branching relationships
- Session completion status

Each tool call updates this state and provides formatted responses that help users follow the thinking process.
