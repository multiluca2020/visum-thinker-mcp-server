/**
 * Transportation Network Analysis Problem
 * 
 * Scenario: We need to analyze traffic flow patterns in a downtown area
 * with multiple intersection points and varying demand throughout the day.
 * 
 * Available Tools via MCP:
 * - sequential_thinking: For structured problem analysis
 * - check_visum: For transportation software integration  
 * - load_visum_model: For network model loading
 * - run_visum_calculation: For traffic calculations
 * - get_network_statistics: For network analysis
 * - analyze_visum_matrices: For demand analysis
 * - export_visum_results: For result export
 * 
 * Instructions for Copilot:
 * 1. Use sequential_thinking to break down this problem
 * 2. Check if Visum is available on the system
 * 3. Guide through the analysis workflow
 * 4. Suggest appropriate calculations and outputs
