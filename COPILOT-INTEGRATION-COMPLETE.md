#### Example Workflows

##### Transportation Analysis
```
@copilot 
I need to analyze traffic flow in a downtown network. Can you:
1. Use sequential thinking to plan the analysis
2. Check if Visum is available  
3. Guide me through loading a network model
4. Set up appropriate traffic calculations
5. Help export and interpret results
```

##### Problem Solving
```
@copilot 
I have a complex engineering problem. Please use the sequential thinking tool to:
1. Break it down into manageable components
2. Analyze each component systematically  
3. Identify potential solutions
4. Recommend the best approach
```

##### Document Analysis
```
@copilot
Load the PDF report from ./reports/traffic-study.pdf and:
1. Extract key traffic volume data
2. Identify peak hour patterns
3. Use sequential thinking to analyze findings
4. Suggest improvements based on the data
```

### ðŸš€ Advanced Features

#### Context-Aware Code Generation
Copilot now understands:
- Transportation planning terminology
- Visum API patterns and best practices

#### Workflow Automation
```typescript
// Copilot can now suggest complete workflows like:
class TransportationAnalysis {
  async analyzeNetwork() {
    // Copilot suggests using MCP tools:
    // 1. sequential_thinking for planning
    // 2. check_visum for software validation  
    // 3. load_visum_model for data loading
    // 4. run_visum_calculation for analysis
    // 5. export_visum_results for output
  }
}
```
